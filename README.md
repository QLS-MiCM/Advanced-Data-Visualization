-   Time: 1PM-3PM ET
-   Instructor: Han Yu
-   Facilitators: Adrien Osakwe & César Miguel Valdez Córdova

This 'Advanced Data Visualization in R' seminar, offered by the Quantitative Life Sciences - McGill Initiative in Computational Medicine (QLS-MiCM) through the Statistical Society of Canada, will introduce participants to creating flexible, aesthetic and informative visualizations in R for statistical computing through the Grammar of Graphics framework. The seminar explores the fundamental concepts and structure of ggplot2 commands and will guide you in selecting the most effective visualizations for your data. Moving to advanced customization, participants will learn techniques for transforming data with scales, using faceting for complex comparisons, and enhancing visual aesthetics through themes and formatting options.

The seminar will also dive into specialized plots (e.g., heatmaps, Kaplan-Meier curves) and explore interactive features using the plotly package and showcase extending the former through the Shiny web application framework. The workshop will emphasize the importance of working with and understanding your data, to allow for tailoring visualizations to extract the most out of your data for your audience, equipping participants with a versatile toolkit for effective data storytelling.
